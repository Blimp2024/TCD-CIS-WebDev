Crocodiles are decent.

They are large, simiaquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Australia. Their snout is how to tell the difference from a Crocodile and an Alligator. They lived from about 95 million years ago. Male crocodiles are larger than females and can reach about 20 feet in length but rarely exceed 14 feet in the wild.
